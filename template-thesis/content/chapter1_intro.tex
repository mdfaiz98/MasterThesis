\section{Motivation \gls*{gptmo}} 

Industry 4.0, also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, has brought about significant transformations, particularly in the manufacturing sector. This revolution has been characterised by the introduction of intelligent technologies such as the \gls{IoT}, cloud connectivity, big data, and human-robot collaboration. These advancements have led to notable improvements and innovations, with the core principle and driving force of innovation in Industry 4.0 being the enhancement of efficiency and productivity. Human-robot collaboration, a key component of Industry 4.0, has played a massive role in this advancement by bringing humans closer together and facilitating more efficient and cooperative workflows. 

Traditionally, industrial robots like robot manipulators, autonomous mobile robots, and gantry models have been kept separate from human workers primarily due to safety concerns. These robots, with their large size, substantial weight, and high speed, pose potential hazards when in close proximity to humans. This traditional approach prioritised the physical separation of robots and humans in industrial settings. However, advancements in Industry 4.0 have significantly increased the use of collaborative robots (cobots), bringing them closer together to accomplish tasks jointly. This evolutionary progression has witnessed the transformation of robots from being secluded behind safety barriers to now operating side-by-side with their human counterparts, effectively capitalizing on their unique capabilities which combine human adaptability and decision-making skills with the precision and consistency offered by robots.  

Looking towards the future of the emerging Industry 5.0, the focus shifts towards a more human-centric approach \parencite{industry5}. Industry 5.0 aims to strike a balance between technological advancements and human needs and interests. The goal is to merge the technological efficiency of Industry 4.0 with a greater emphasis on enhancing human operator's well-being and satisfaction.
Industry 5.0 seeks to address the human challenges related to Industry 4.0 by prioritizing the well-being of workers and placing them at the center of the manufacturing process \parencite{hum1}.
This shows a significant shift from purely efficiency-driven operations to those that also prioritise human factors and environmental sustainability. 

With a focus on the human centrism aspect of Industry 5.0, this thesis aims to delve into the human aspect of human-robot interaction, considering how proximity to robots and different control strategies might affect the operator's physiological state. It aims to investigate how continuous interaction with robots impacts the stress levels experienced by humans and emphasises the importance of monitoring and accurately assessing stress levels in human-robot collaborative environments. \textcite{Saupp} have previously indicated that cobots have the ability to influence the mental states of human workers, as they are often perceived as social entities. The close proximity of humans to robots in the workplace can lead to heightened stress levels, mainly if the robot's movements appear to be potentially harmful \parencite{Lasota}. For instance, if a co-robot swiftly moves towards a worker or follows an unpredictable path, it may induce feelings of anxiety or fear due to the perceived risk of sustaining an injury. This, in turn, can negatively impact both productivity and the efficacy of human-robot collaboration. Furthermore, it can impede the complete utilization of the advanced capabilities offered by collaborative robots. As robots become more autonomous and capable, identifying and addressing these stress factors is critical to optimizing human-robot collaboration for enhanced productivity and making the working environment effective, efficient and safe. 


\section{Aim of the Thesis \gls*{gptmo}}

The primary objective of this thesis is to evaluate the impact of varying collision avoidance strategies on human stress levels within the context of human-robot interaction. This involves conducting a study to collect and analyze data, aiming to understand the varying stress levels concerning different robot collision avoidance strategies while considering various collaboration levels and robot control strategies. Subsequently, the data obtained is utilised to develop a predictive model capable of identifying and addressing sources of stress during human-robot collaboration.


Specifically, the primary objectives of the thesis are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Assessment of Human Stress Levels }: Develop a holistic approach for evaluating stress levels in human-robot interactions during different collaboration levels and robot control strategies, combining both objective physiological measures and subjective experiences. Objectively, the study will employ various physiological indicators such as \gls{BVP}, \gls{EDA}, \gls{HR}, and body posture analysis. These indicators will provide quantifiable data on the body's physiological response to robot interactions. Subjectively, the study aims to incorporate personal feedback from participants gathered through questionnaires. This will offer insights into their personal feelings and perceptions regarding their interactions with robots. By blending these objective and subjective methods, the study aims to understand stress in human-robot interactions comprehensively.
    This entails designing an acquisition system that successfully takes data from several sensors at different frequencies and synchronises it. Devices such as the Empatica E4 wristband \textcite{emp} are used for gathering data on \gls{BVP}, \gls{EDA} and other parameters, as well as a motion capture system to record human posture and movement. A vital aspect would be to synchronise these many data streams, ensuring accurate and consistent assessment of human physiological states across different robot interaction scenarios. 
    An important aspect was designing and conducting a subject study to collect data on participants' physiological responses while doing different assembly tasks under different human-robot interaction scenarios. These scenarios included three distinct levels of robot collision avoidance strategies: No collision avoidance, dynamic collision avoidance, and predictive collision avoidance, as well as three different collaboration levels: separated workspace with the cobot, shared workspace, and shared workspace with direct collaboration. The aim is to gather comprehensive data to analyze the impact of these varying robot control strategies on human stress levels. 
    \item \textbf{Stress Prediction Model}: Developing a model for predicting and classifying stress levels during human-robot collaboration. This model trained on the dataset of human physiological responses collected from the subject study. Various preprocessing and feature engineering techniques are used to prepare the data for the model.
    Various machine learning models, such as \gls{KNN}, \gls{SVM}, and others, are evaluated to determine the best model for predicting stress levels. The ultimate goal of this model is to provide a reliable tool for real-time monitoring and assessment of stress levels during human-robot collaboration. Accurately identifying stress-inducing factors and patterns can contribute to the development of proactive interventions and collision avoidance strategies that can enhance the overall well-being and performance of individuals engaged in human-robot interaction scenarios.

\section{Related Work}

\Textcite{review1}, \textcite{arsalan}, \textcite{1} have all done a comprehensive review of various stress detection and assessment methods.  This literature review from our part relies on the knowledge gained by these authors.
There are some publicly available datasets for human stress detection which are commonly used throughout the literature. \textcite{wesad} is one such dataset and motion data from 15 participants, split into 12 males and 3 females, in a lab environment. The study included three conditions: a baseline with a reading task, a condition involving watching funny videos, and a stress condition triggered by the Trier Social Stressor Test. It includes sensor data like electrocardiography and electrodermal activity.

Similarly, the SWELL-KW dataset by \textcite{swell} is focused on stress detection in knowledge work tasks. It was compiled from 25 participants engaged in various activities such as report writing and email checking. To induce stress, participants were informed about presenting their work for full participation credit. The experiment recorded data over three hours for each participant, divided into blocks with relaxation periods followed by tasks. This dataset is geared towards understanding stress in workplace environments.

Another dataset for assessing social stress in humans using physiological signals was presented by \textcite{1234}. This study involved 68 undergraduate psychology students and utilised blood volume pulse and electrodermal activity for data collection. Additionally, video recording was conducted to measure remote photoplethysmography and facial features. The experiment utilised the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory (CSAI) questionnaire to measure self-reported anxiety across cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and self-confidence dimensions. The Trier Social Stress Test was employed as a stimulus, during which both physiological signals and video recordings were performed.

  Regarding stress levels during human robot collaboration, \textcite{Arai2010-be}highlighted the stress-inducing potential of high-speed robot movements, advocating for advance warnings in such situations. \textcite{Dragan2015-vv} shifted focus to robot motion planning, revealing that clear, intent-expressing movements aid in smoother, less stressful human-robot collaboration. Most recently,\textcite{Lu2022-kj} found that slow, visually trackable, and restricted movements of a robot's end effector cause significantly less mental stress. Nevertheless, there remains a notable gap in research regarding collision strategies, particularly in the context of dynamic collision avoidance or predictive collision prevention methods. Few studies have delved into developing stress detection models based on these strategies, which could potentially be employed as real-time monitoring feedback systems. This area represents a promising direction for future research, aiming to enhance safety and efficiency in human-robot interactions.

subsection*{Physiological indicators of mental stress}
ome studies focus on reviewing the current state of affairs related to human stress detection. For instance, a review on human stress detection using bio-signals is presented in (Giannakakis et al., 2019). However, a discussion about the psychological, physical, and behavioral measures of human stress is found lacking. Further, publicly available databases for human stress measurement were also not explored. In another study, objective, subjective, physical, and behavioral measures for stress detection, as well as publicly available data used for human stress, are discussed. Another application-specific human stress measurement survey focusing on driver stress level is presented in (Rastgoo et al., 2018). Physical and physiological measures o

Mental Stress Detection using Data from Wearable and Non-Wearable Sensors: A Review 5 human stress for driver stress detection are explored in detail. The limitation of this survey is that it only discusses a specific application i.e., driver stress level, and is not generic.
