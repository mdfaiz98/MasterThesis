\section{Subjective Measures}
Mental stress can be assessed through subjective and objective
measures. Subjective ratings, such as self-report questionnaires, have
been commonly used to estimate levels of mental stress in humans
(Aigrain et al., 2018). Participants are asked to answer a variety of
questions about their experiences in the experiment. The NASA-Task
Load Index (NASA-TLX) has been utilized in numerous research
studies to assess peopleâ€™s mental stress levels. For instance, Zheng et al.
(2012) employed the NASA-TLX to investigate the mental workload
experienced by surgeons during endoscopy training. In the context of
smart factories, Zakeri et al. (2021) applied the NASA-TLX to examine
various factors contributing to mental stress, such as task complexity,
time constraints, and collaboration duration. However, it is important to
acknowledge the limitations of self-reporting, as participants cannot
report in real-time and may not express their true feelings (Bethel et al.,
2007).
