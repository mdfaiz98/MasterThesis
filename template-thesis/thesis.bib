ABSTRACT = {Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain ndash;machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.},

abstract = {The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator’s physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator’s performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’ mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing.}

    abstract = {This paper introduces activity-related behavioural features that can be automatically extracted from a computer system, with the aim to increase the effectiveness of automatic stress detection. The proposed features are based on processing of appropriate video and accelerometer recordings taken from the monitored subjects. For the purposes of the present study, an experiment was conducted that utilized a stress-induction protocol based on the stroop colour word test. Video, accelerometer and biosignal (Electrocardiogram and Galvanic Skin Response) recordings were collected from nineteen participants. Then, an explorative study was conducted by following a methodology mainly based on spatiotemporal descriptors (Motion History Images) that are extracted from video sequences. A large set of activity-related behavioural features, potentially useful for automatic stress detection, were proposed and examined. Experimental evaluation showed that several of these behavioural features significantly correlate to self-reported stress. Moreover, it was found that the use of the proposed features can significantly enhance the performance of typical automatic stress detection systems, commonly based on biosignal processing.},
