ABSTRACT = {Staying at the top is getting tougher and more challenging due to the fast-growing and changing digital technologies and AI-based solutions. The world of technology, mass customization, and advanced manufacturing is experiencing a rapid transformation. Robots are becoming even more important as they can now be coupled with the human mind by means of brain ndash;machine interface and advances in artificial intelligence. A strong necessity to increase productivity while not removing human workers from the manufacturing industry is imposing punishing challenges on the global economy. To counter these challenges, this article introduces the concept of Industry 5.0, where robots are intertwined with the human brain and work as collaborator instead of competitor. This article also outlines a number of key features and concerns that every manufacturer may have about Industry 5.0. In addition, it presents several developments achieved by researchers for use in Industry 5.0 applications and environments. Finally, the impact of Industry 5.0 on the manufacturing industry and overall economy is discussed from an economic and productivity point of view, where it is argued that Industry 5.0 will create more jobs than it will take away.},

               user-independent and personal stress detection",
  author    = "Siirtola, Pekka and R{\"o}ning, Juha",
  abstract  = "In this article, regression and classification models are
               compared for stress detection. Both personal and
               user-independent models are experimented. The article is based
               on publicly open dataset called AffectiveROAD, which contains
               data gathered using Empatica E4 sensor and unlike most of the
               other stress detection datasets, it contains continuous target
               variables. The used classification model is Random Forest and
               the regression model is Bagged tree based ensemble. Based on
               experiments, regression models outperform classification models,
               when classifying observations as stressed or not-stressed. The
               best user-independent results are obtained using a combination
               of blood volume pulse and skin temperature features, and using
               these the average balanced accuracy was 74.1\% with
               classification model and 82.3\% using regression model. In
               addition, regression models can be used to estimate the level of
               the stress. Moreover, the results based on models trained using
               personal data are not encouraging showing that biosignals have a
               lot of variation not only between the study subjects but also
               between the session gathered from the same person. On the other
               hand, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection for
               user-independent model, it is possible to improve recognition
               models more than by using personal training data to build
               personal models. In fact, it is shown that with subject-wise
               feature selection, the average detection rate can be improved as
               much as 4\%-units, and it is especially useful to reduce the
               variance in the recognition rates between the study subjects.",

abstract = {The ongoing trend toward Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary workplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production chain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing the operator’s physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid safety hazards. However, as the production complexity increases, the cognitive resources demand and mental workload could compromise the operator’s performance and the efficiency of the shop floor workplace. State-of-the-art methods in cognitive science work offline and/or involve bulky equipment hardly deployable in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel method for online assessment of cognitive load in manufacturing, primarily assembly, by detecting patterns in human motion directly from the input images of a stereo camera. Head pose estimation and skeleton tracking are exploited to investigate the workers’ attention and assess hyperactivity and unforeseen movements. Pilot experiments suggest that our factor assessment tool provides significant insights into workers’ mental workload, even confirmed by correlations with physiological and performance measurements. According to data gathered in this study, a vision-based cognitive load assessment has the potential to be integrated into the development of mechatronic systems for improving cognitive ergonomics in manufacturing.}

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive review of methods covering significant subjective and objective human stress detection techniques available in the literature. The methods for measuring human stress responses could include subjective questionnaires (developed by psychologists) and objective markers observed using data from wearable and non-wearable sensors. In particular, wearable sensor-based methods commonly use data from electroencephalography, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, electromyography, electrodermal activity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and photoplethysmography both individually and in multimodal fusion strategies. Whereas, methods based on non-wearable sensors include strategies such as analyzing pupil dilation and speech, smartphone data, eye movement, body posture, and thermal imaging. Whenever a stressful situation is encountered by an individual, physiological, physical, or behavioral change is induced which help in coping with the challenge at hand. A wide range of studies has attempted to establish a relationship between these stressful situations and the response of human beings by using different kinds of psychological, physiological, physical, and behavioral measures. Inspired by the lack of availability of a definitive verdict about the relationship of human stress with these different kinds of markers, a detailed survey about human stress detection methods is conducted in this paper. In particular, we explore how stress detection methods can benefit from artificial intelligence utilizing relevant data from various sources. This review will prove to be a reference document that would provide guidelines for future research enabling effective detection of human stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Wearable sensors have shown promise as a non-intrusive method for collecting biomarkers that may correlate with levels of elevated stress. Stressors cause a variety of biological responses, and these physiological reactions can be measured using biomarkers including Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Heart Rate (HR) that represent the stress response from the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), and the immune system. While Cortisol response magnitude remains the gold standard indicator for stress assessment [1], recent advances in wearable technologies have resulted in the availability of a number of consumer devices capable of recording HRV, EDA and HR sensor biomarkers, amongst other signals. At the same time, researchers have been applying machine learning techniques to the recorded biomarkers in order to build models that may be able to predict elevated levels of stress.
Objective: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of machine learning techniques utilized in prior research with a speciﬁc focus on model generalization when using these public datasets as training data. We also shed light on the challenges and opportunities that machine learning-enabled stress monitoring and detection face.
Methods: This study reviewed published works contributing and/or using public datasets designed for detecting stress and their associated machine learning methods. The electronic databases of Google Scholar, Crossref, DOAJ and PubMed were searched for relevant articles and a total of 33 articles were identiﬁed and included in the ﬁnal analysis. The reviewed works were synthesized into three categories of publicly available stress datasets, machine learning techniques applied using those, and future research directions. For the machine learning studies reviewed, we provide an analysis of their approach to results validation and model generalization. The quality assessment of the included studies was conducted in accordance with the IJMEDI checklist [2].
Results: A number of public datasets were identiﬁed that are labeled for stress detection. These datasets were most commonly produced from sensor biomarker data recorded using the Empatica E4 device, a well-studied, medical-grade wrist-worn wearable that provides sensor biomarkers most notable to correlate with elevated levels of stress. Most of the reviewed datasets contain less than twenty-four hours of data, and the varied experimental conditions and labeling methodologies potentially limit their ability to generalize for unseen data. In addition, we discuss that previous works show shortcomings in areas such as their labeling protocols, lack of statistical power, validity of stress biomarkers, and model generalization ability.
Conclusion: Health tracking and monitoring using wearable devices is growing in popularity, while the generalization of existing machine learning models still requires further study, and research in this area will continue to provide improvements as newer and more substantial datasets become available.},

    abstract = { This paper outlines a simplified theory to explain the behaviour of photoelectric plethysmographs used for the measurement of blood flow in the skin. The paper reports the finding that light diffusing through blood, from a source outside a blood vessel, can diffuse preferentially in the direction of motion of the blood, and that this preferential diffusion is likely to arise from a combination of the plasma skimming which occurs at the vessel wall and from the orientation effects of the erythrocytes in motion. }

Research involving EDA has been reported in practically all psychology, psychiatry, and psychophysiology research journals. The wide range of journals in which EDA research is published reflects the fact that EDA measures have been applied to a wide variety of questions ranging from basic research examining attention, information processing, and emotion, to more applied clinical research examining predictors and/or correlates of normal and abnormal behavior. The application of EDA measures to a wide variety of issues is due in large part to its relative ease of measurement and quantification combined with its sensitivity to psychological states and processes. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a tutorial overview of EDA for interested students, researchers, and practitioners who are not specialists in this particular system. The authors begin with a historical orientation and then discuss the physical, inferential, psychological, and social aspects of EDA. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

Some authors have suggested that cognitions elicit nonspecific skin conductance responses. These cognitions may resemble the stimuli that evoke a specific skin conductance response. In a within subjects design (n=31 graduate students) the onset of nonspecific skin conductance responses triggered a signal for the subject to rate cognitions on several indices. These ratings (“absent” to “fully present”) were compared with samples in the absence of phasic electrodermal activity. The subjects’current concerns, negative emotion, subjective arousal, and inner speech were rated to be significantly more intense at the time of nonspecific skin conductance responses compared to electrodermal nonresponding periods. Cognitive processes seem to be concomitants of nonspecific skin conductance responses.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The Industry 5.0 emerges as a new paradigm for the industry by considering sustainability, human-centered approaches, organizational resilience, and interaction between humans and machines as its core values. This new trend for the future of the industry is referred to as neoindustrialization. Due to being a topic in development, there is still no precise consensus on its definition, which prompted the current study to comprehensively investigate and analyze the existing literature on Industry 5.0. Methods: The method employed was a scoping review, examining publications from various databases and academic journals, including those specific to the Brazilian context. Results: The results indicate a transition towards an industry that meets societal demands and respects planetary boundaries, aspects that were overlooked by Industry 4.0. Conclusions: In this new scenario, the industry reassumes its leadership by combining technology with new strategies and organizational models. Furthermore, it undergoes organizational changes to align its structure, operations, human resources, and new practices, aiming to meet the demands of society and all stakeholders involved. To achieve this, it is necessary to create an environment conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship, promoting the development of qualified human capital, investments in research and development, and strengthening partnerships between the public and private sectors. A successful neoindustrialization policy will generate high-quality jobs and foster economic growth. Industry 5.0 is the paradigm that will prevail in the 21st century. It is not a matter of speculation; it is an inseparable and inevitable reality. Otherwise, the industry will be relegated to a secondary role in the process of digital and social transformation.},

	abstract = {Stress is an escalated psycho-physiological state of the human body emerging in response to a challenging event or a demanding condition. Environmental factors that trigger stress are called stressors. In case of prolonged exposure to multiple stressors impacting simultaneously, a person’s mental and physical health can be adversely affected which can further lead to chronic health issues. To prevent stress-related issues, it is necessary to detect them in the nascent stages which are possible only by continuous monitoring of stress. Wearable devices promise real-time and continuous data collection, which helps in personal stress monitoring. In this paper, a comprehensive review has been presented, which focuses on stress detection using wearable sensors and applied machine learning techniques. This paper investigates the stress detection approaches adopted in accordance with the sensory devices such as wearable sensors, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Photoplethysmography (PPG), and also depending on various environments like during driving, studying, and working. The stressors, techniques, results, advantages, limitations, and issues for each study are highlighted and expected to provide a path for future research studies. Also, a multimodal stress detection system using a wearable sensor-based deep learning technique has been proposed at the end.},

abstract = {The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) is a non-verbal pictorial assessment technique that directly measures the pleasure, arousal, and dominance associated with a person's affective reaction to a wide variety of stimuli. In this experiment, we compare reports of affective experience obtained using SAM, which requires only three simple judgments, to the Semantic Differential scale devised by Mehrabian and Russell (An approach to environmental psychology, 1974) which requires 18 different ratings. Subjective reports were measured to a series of pictures that varied in both affective valence and intensity. Correlations across the two rating methods were high both for reports of experienced pleasure and felt arousal. Differences obtained in the dominance dimension of the two instruments suggest that SAM may better track the personal response to an affective stimulus. SAM is an inexpensive, easy method for quickly assessing reports of affective response in many contexts.}

Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload.}

abstract = {Summary Collaborative robots have to adapt its motion plan to a dynamic environment and variation of task constraints. Currently, they detect collisions and interrupt or postpone their motion plan to prevent harm to humans or objects. The more advanced strategy proposed in this article uses online trajectory optimization to anticipate potential collisions, task variations, and to adapt the motion plan accordingly. The online trajectory planner pursues a model predictive control approach to account for dynamic motion objectives and constraints during task execution. The prediction model relates reference joint velocities to actual joint positions as an approximation of built-in robot tracking controllers. The optimal control problem is solved with direct collocation based on a hypergraph structure, which represents the nonlinear program and allows to efficiently adapt to structural changes in the optimization problem caused by moving obstacles. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the robot imitates pick-and-place tasks while avoiding self-collisions, semistatic, and dynamic obstacles, including a person. The analysis of the approach concerns computation time, constraint violations, and smoothness. It shows that after model identification, order reduction, and validation on the real robot, parallel integrators with compensation for input delays exhibit the best compromise between accuracy and computational complexity. The model predictive controller can successfully approach a moving target configuration without prior knowledge of the reference motion. The results show that pure hard constraints are not sufficient and lead to nonsmooth controls. In combination with soft constraints, which evaluate the proximity of obstacles, smooth and safe trajectories are planned.},

Then they listened to two musical selections, one of which they rated as evoking arousing, negative emotions while the other was rated as evoking calm, positive emotions. During the first musical selection that was presented, the arousing, negative emotion music terminated skin temperature increases and perpetuated skin temperature decreases, whereas the calm, positive emotion selection terminated skin temperature decreases and perpetuated skin temperature increases. During the second musical selection, skin temperature tended to increase whichever music was played; however, the increases were significant only during the calm, positive emotion music. It was concluded that music initially affects skin temperature in ways that can be predicted from affective rating scales, although the effect of some selections may depend upon what, if any, music had been previously heard.},

abstract="In today's advancing world, as technology is evolving by leaps and bounds, it is also creating various stress symptoms among people. Diseases such as stress, anxiety, depression, and ADHD are commonly found in the younger generation. This is all contributed to various factors such as lifestyle choices, social and economic pressure, and low self-esteem. Workload, immense social and economic pressure, and family responsibilities are other factors that impose increasing levels of stress on individuals. Hence, detection and analysis of stress at early stages can reduce severe consequences and risks that may occur in the future. In modern times, advancement in technology has created a need for evolution in the medical sector. As a result, it is crucial to predict and analyze various symptoms that cause stress so that it is easier to find their treatment as soon as possible. Thus, this evolved the need for bioinformatics to work with machine learning. With the help of various machine learning methodologies, it is now easy to predict and analyze stress in people at their initial stages. In this manuscript, various techniques of machine learning have been examined that are used to analyze stress and its symptoms. These include techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.",

journal = {Physiological Measurement},
abstract = {Objective: Mental stress is detrimental to cardiovascular health, being a risk factor for coronary heart disease and a trigger for cardiac events. However, it is not currently routinely assessed. The aim of this study was to identify features of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) pulse wave which are indicative of mental stress. Approach: A numerical model of pulse wave propagation was used to simulate blood pressure signals, from which simulated PPG pulse waves were estimated using a transfer function. Pulse waves were simulated at six levels of stress by changing the model input parameters both simultaneously and individually, in accordance with haemodynamic changes associated with stress. Thirty-two feature measurements were extracted from pulse waves at three measurement sites: the brachial, radial and temporal arteries. Features which changed significantly with stress were identified using the Mann–Kendall monotonic trend test. Main results: Seventeen features exhibited significant trends with stress in measurements from at least one site. Three features showed significant trends at all three sites: the time from pulse onset to peak, the time from the dicrotic notch to pulse end, and the pulse rate. More features showed significant trends at the radial artery (15) than the brachial (8) or temporal (7) arteries. Most features were influenced by multiple input parameters. Significance: The features identified in this study could be used to monitor stress in healthcare and consumer devices. Measurements at the radial artery may provide superior performance than the brachial or temporal arteries. In vivo studies are required to confirm these observations.}

	abstract = {This review investigates the effects of psychological stress on the human body measured through biosignals. When a potentially threatening stimulus is perceived, a cascade of physiological processes occurs mobilizing the body and nervous system to confront the imminent threat and ensure effective adaptation. Biosignals that can be measured reliably in relation to such stressors include physiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG) and physical measures (respiratory rate, speech, skin temperature, pupil size, eye activity). A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efficiency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on biosignal patterns caused during stress conditions and reliable practical guidelines towards more efficient detection of stress.},

The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all comparisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.},

               was performed at St Mary's Hospital (Imperial College London,
               London, UK), in a tertiary setting. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five
               participants (10 vascular surgical residents, 4 surgical
               interns, 12 theatre nurses, 2 attending vascular surgeons, 6
               medical students and 1 technician) were recruited from the
               Imperial Vascular Unit at St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College
               London by direct approach. All participants finished the study.
               RESULTS: Junior surgeons experienced significantly increased
               sympathetic tone (Low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio)
               during team simulation compared to individual simulation (6.01
               $\pm$ 1.68 vs. 8.32 $\pm$ 2.84, p < 0.001). Within team
               simulation junior surgeons experienced significantly higher
               heart rate (beats per minute) than their senior counterparts (82
               $\pm$ 5.83 vs. 76 $\pm$ 6.02, p = 0.033). Subjective workload
               scores (NASA Task Load Index [NASA-TLX]) correlated moderately
               and significantly with sympathetic tone in surgeons across all
               stages of simulation. (r = 0.39, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A
               discrete, measurable increase in stress is experienced by
               surgeons during high-fidelity endovascular simulation and
               differentially effects junior surgeons. High-fidelity team
               simulation may have a role to play in improving nontechnical
               skill, reducing intra-operative stress, and reducing error.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The NASA Task Load Index is a questionnaire widely
               used in aviation. This index might help for attesting the
               quality of a scenario in high-fidelity simulation in healthcare.
               The main purpose of this study was to observe whether NASA Task
               Load Index for critical care-simulated scenarios, designed for
               residents, was consistent with the literature. The second
               purpose was to describe relationships between NASA Task Load
               Index, performance and generated stress during high-fidelity
               simulation. METHODS: All residents in anaesthesia and intensive
               care undergoing high-fidelity simulation were included. The
               primary endpoint was the task load generated by each scenario
               assessed by NASA Task Load Index. Based on the literature, the
               NASA Task Load Index scores between 39 and 61 were considered an
               acceptable level. Stress level (Visual Analogue Scale) and
               specific technical and non-technical skills performances (Team
               Emergency Assessment Measure) were also assessed. RESULTS:
               Totally 53 residents actively participated in 1 of 10 different
               scenarios, between June and December 2017. The median NASA Task
               Load Index score of scenarios was 61 [48-65]. Five scenarios
               generated acceptable task load levels. There was no association
               between the NASA Task Load Index score and technical or
               non-technical skills performance scores, but an association
               between NASA Task Load Index and the stress level (rho=4.7, P
               =.001) was observed. CONCLUSION: Simulation scenarios generate
               different task loads for residents; the task load was deemed
               acceptable for half of the scenarios. The NASA Task Load Index
               could be considered as a tool to assess the pedagogic adequacy
               of scenarios. Scenario and generated stress level, but not task
               load, can modify residents' performance during simulation. This
               should be considered when planning normative simulation.",

               various physiological signals and algorithms. However, there is
               still a gap in research efforts moving from laboratory studies
               to real-world settings. A small number of research has verified
               when a physiological response is a reaction to an extrinsic
               stimulus of the participant's environment in real-world
               settings. Typically, physiological signals are correlated with
               the spatial characteristics of the physical environment,
               supported by video records or interviews. The present research
               aims to bridge the gap between laboratory settings and
               real-world field studies by introducing a new algorithm that
               leverages the capabilities of wearable physiological sensors to
               detect moments of stress (MOS). We propose a rule-based
               algorithm based on galvanic skin response and skin temperature,
               combing empirical findings with expert knowledge to ensure
               transferability between laboratory settings and real-world field
               studies. To verify our algorithm, we carried out a laboratory
               experiment to create a ``gold standard'' of physiological
               responses to stressors. We validated the algorithm in real-world
               field studies using a mixed-method approach by spatially
               correlating the participant's perceived stress, geo-located
               questionnaires, and the corresponding real-world situation from
               the video. Results show that the algorithm detects MOS with 84\%
               accuracy, showing high correlations between measured (by
               wearable sensors), reported (by questionnaires and eDiary
               entries), and recorded (by video) stress events. The urban
               stressors that were identified in the real-world studies
               originate from traffic congestion, dangerous driving situations,
               and crowded areas such as tourist attractions. The presented
               research can enhance stress detection in real life and may thus

                     by containing three different affective states (neutral,

                     a benchmark is created on the dataset, using well-known
                     features and standard machine learning methods.
                     Considering the three-class classification problem (

                     classification accuracies of up to 80\%,. In the binary

                     from a Kinect 3D sensor and heart rate (variability) and
                     skin conductance from body sensors. The dataset made
                     available not only contains raw data, but also
                     preprocessed data and extracted features. The
                     participants' subjective experience on task load, mental
                     effort, emotion and perceived stress was assessed with
                     validated questionnaires as a ground truth. The resulting
                     dataset on working behavior and affect is a valuable
                     contribution to several research fields, such as work

               that has gained tremendous attention from both academia and
               industry. Since some robot-related factors can elicit mental
               stress or have negative psychological effects on human workers,
               it is essential to understand these factors and maintain
               workers' mental stress at a low level. Galvanic Skin Response
               (GSR) measures skin conductance and is known to be a
               physiological measurement that reflects short-term mental
               stress. Typically, skin conductance increases in response to
               greater mental stress. In this study, the mental stress caused
               by the hand-over activities of a collaborative robot was
               investigated using both GSR as an objective measurement and
               NASA-Task Load Index (TLX) as a subjective assessment. Several
               robot-related factors that may lead to mental stress were
               experimentally examined. GSR outcomes indicated that end
               effector approaching within workers' view, low end effector
               speed, and constrained end effector trajectory led to a
               significantly lower skin conductance. Some aspects of the
               NASA-TLX also indicated that speed and trajectory significantly
               affected the scores. Yet, no significant differences were found

  abstract  = "The early detection of mental stress is critical for efficient
               clinical treatment. As compared with traditional approaches, the
               automatic methods presented in literature have shown
               significance and effectiveness in terms of diagnosis speed.
               Unfortunately, the majority of them mainly focus on accuracy
               rather than predictions for treatment efficacy. This may result
               in the development of methods that are less robust and accurate,
               which is unsuitable for clinical purposes. In this study, we
               propose a comprehensive framework for the early detection of
               mental stress by analysing variations in both
               electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals
               from 22 male subjects (mean age: 22.54 $\pm$ 1.53 years). The
               significant contribution of this paper is that the presented
               framework is capable of performing predictions for treatment
               efficacy, which is achieved by defining four stress levels and
               creating models for the individual level. The experimental
               results indicate that the framework has realised an accuracy, a
               sensitivity, and a specificity of 79.54\%, 81\%, and 78\%,
               respectively. Moreover, the results indicate significant
               neurophysiological differences between the stress and control

               is related to a wide variety of diseases and is mainly caused by
               daily-life factors. The use of mobile technology for healthcare
               purposes has dramatically increased during the last few years.
               In particular, for out-of-lab stress detection, a considerable
               number of biosignal-based methods and systems have been
               proposed. However, these approaches have not matured yet into
               applications that are reliable and useful enough to
               significantly improve people's quality of life. Further research
               is needed. In this paper, we propose a portable system for
               real-time detection of stress based on multiple biosignals such
               as electroencephalography, electrocardiography,
               electromyography, and galvanic skin response. In order to
               validate our system, we conducted a study using a previously
               published and well-established methodology. In our study, ten
               subjects were stressed and then relaxed while their biosignals
               were simultaneously recorded with the portable system. The
               results show that our system can classify three levels of stress
               (stress, relax, and neutral) with a resolution of a few seconds
               and 86\% accuracy. This suggests that the proposed system could
               have a relevant impact on people's lives. It can be used to
               prevent stress episodes in many situations of everyday life such

               stress detection based on multimodal feature analysis and
               kernel-based classifiers. Physiological signals such as
               electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response and respiration were
               record from fourteen drives executed in a prescribed route at
               real drive environments. Features were widely extracted from
               time, spectral and wavelet multi-domains. In order to search for
               the optimal feature sets, Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) and
               Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined and adopted.
               Kernel-based classifiers were employed to improve the accuracy
               of stress detection task. Analysis I used features from 10 s
               intervals of data which were recorded during well-defined rest,
               highway and city driving conditions to discriminate three levels
               of diving stress achieving an averaging accuracy over 99\% at
               per-drive level and 89\% in cross-drive validation. Analysis II
               made continuous stress evaluation throughout a complete driving
               test attaining a high coincidence with the true road situation
               especially at the switching interval of traffic conditions.
               Experimental results reveal that different levels of driving
               stress can be characterized by specific set of physiological
               measures. These physiological measures could be applied to
               in-vehicle intelligent systems in various approaches to help the
               drivers better manage their negative driving status. Our design
               scheme for driving stress detection could also facilitate the
               development of similar in-vehicle expert systems, such as
               driver's emotion management, driver's sleeping onset monitoring,
