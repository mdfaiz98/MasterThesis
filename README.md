## Abstract:
The integration of collaborative robots into shared workspaces with humans has become
a pivotal aspect of modern manufacturing processes, heralding a new era of human-robot
interaction. This thesis addresses the human element in these interactions by investigating
the impact of varying robot collision avoidance strategies on human stress levels. A series of
subject study were conducted to collect physiological, motion capture, and subjective data,
which were then used to analyze the perceived stress levels of participants engaged in tasks
with collaborative robots across various scenarios. Different collision avoidance strategies
were implemented to study their impact on human stress levels. Another key aspect of
the research was the development of a stress prediction model. This model, trained on
the data collected thought the subject study, utilizing various preprocessing and feature
engineering techniques. Machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Support
Vector Machines and Random Forest, among others were evaluated to identify the most
effective approach for predicting stress levels. Notably, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines achieved the highest accuracy of 94% and 91.6% respectively. In summary, this thesis explores the relationship between the robot collision avoidance
strategies to human stress levels, providing valuable insights for designing more intuitive
and stress-reducing human robot collaborative environments.
