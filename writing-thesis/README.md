# LaTeX Template for Bachelor/Master and PhD Theses

## Usage

Copy this template into your personal repository (e.g. the one created by your supervisor) and extend it as neccessary. Always consult with your supervisor when making bigger changes.

The file `settings/settings.tex` contains some settings, including two toggles to switch between English and German, and PhD and BT/MT. For further questions about the template, consult your supervisor and read the comments in the files.

## Regarding packages

The template follows the idea of NOT containing all packages that any future user might need, as this would render 90% of the packages useless.
it rather provides a basic set of packages whose features are likely to be required during a thesis. Every user can easily add any additional packages locally.
